# Email Spoofing

## SMTP
During a regular Email processing flow


## SPF

## DKIM

## DMARC

## MUA (end user)


## Problem
Email spoofing is a technique of creating email messages with forged sender address, in order to trick the receiver of the email. It is most commonly use for Phising or other types of Malware injection to the victim's computer. Users typically rely on the email server to do the filtering in order to block fradulent emails or separate spam emails from legitamate emails. SPF, DKIM, and Dmarc are the three most widly adopted protocols for email authentication. These three protocols are combined together to verify different parts of an email and ensure email autheticity. However, email forgery, or spoofing, can still be done since there are inconsistency in the entire email processing flow.
